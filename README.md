### Unity AdMob Ads Integration

------------



**This resource is intended to show how Google ads for Unity can be simply added.**

------------



- This file contains only Banner, Interstitial and Rewarded ad types.
- Given ad IDs are test IDs, do not change ad IDs if you are also testing!
- You can access more information for Test IDs here:  [Test ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/test-ads?hl=bg "Test ads")
- For Google AdMob ad types and app IDs, check here: [AdMob ](https://admob.google.com/home/ "AdMob ")
- To download the Google AdMob plugin: [GitHub](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-unity/releases "GitHub")

**❗❗Attention❗❗ If you use your real ad ID when testing, Google may perceive it as artificial ad representation and may prohibit you.**
